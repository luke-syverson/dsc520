  # I can't figure this one out. Oh well. At first I had subsets of the data
  # using the filter(), but rereading the instructions before submission had me
  # attempt to pull this together. The error I get here is:
  # "Results do not have equal length" and I'm not sure why. I'll challenge my
  # understanding of the ddply function this week.

# Identify if there are any outliers

  # It looks like the data has outliers due to its general quantitative right-skewness.
  # It would make sense that the majority of houses sold for less, had less
  # amenities and smaller sizes.

# Create at least 2 new variables
